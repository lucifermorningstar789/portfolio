#Instagram "Like" Bug Simulation 🔁

This Python script simulates a race condition bug in Instagram-style comment likes — where rapid user taps result in multiple likes being registered for the same comment.

 🎯 What It Shows
- Why race conditions matter in real-time user interactions
- How backend systems need to enforce constraints
- Simple concurrency simulation using Python's threading module

* How to Run
```bash
python comment_like_sim.py
